# Todoey âœ“

It is an iOS app to keep track of items in our Todo list. 
The user creates categories. He can enter multiple items in each category.

1. The Core Data was initially used as the databse. Later, to learn about Realm, I changed it to Realm db.
2. App also uses Chameleon Framework to add a new random color to the cell when a new category is added. 
 This color is also stored in db so that same color persists on reloading the app.
3. When a user taps on a category, the cell background color of that category is used in the corresponding Todo List item table for coloring the cells with the shades of that color using Chameleon Framework.
